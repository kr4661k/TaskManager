# TaskManager

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

TaskManager is a simple Java application designed to manage tasks and users.  
It supports creating tasks, assigning them to users, managing task statuses, basic sorting, and input validation.

## Features

- Create and assign tasks to users
- Validate user input (e.g., email format, name length)
- Handle custom exceptions
- Manage task statuses
- Simple task sorting

This project was created to practice Java OOP concepts.  
In the future, it will be updated and expanded to become something more than just a bunch of files ðŸ˜Š

## Project Goals

- Improve understanding of Java core concepts
- Practice using Git and GitHub
- Explore future enhancements: file handling, unit tests, GUI or web interface, and database integration
